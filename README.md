### Shadow DOM Web Component using a Template

Here we see how the shadow DOM and templates can work together to make isolated, reusable components. 

We use `slots` to allow placeholder markup to be "injected" into the template clone of our component.

The repo contains a simple proof of concept for how we tie a template to the shadow DOM and inject markup from the client HTML using slots.

There is also a more complete example to demonstrate real world usage of a reusable component using slots.
